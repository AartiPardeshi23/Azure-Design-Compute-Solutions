# 🌩️ AZ-305: Design Compute Solutions — Practical Lab Series

Welcome to the **AZ-305 (Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert)**  
**Module 08: Design Compute Solutions** hands-on lab series.

This repository contains **five beginner-friendly labs** designed to help you
build, deploy, and manage compute solutions on Azure — from Virtual Machines to
App Services and High Availability Architectures.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of these labs, you’ll be able to:

✅ Design and deploy virtual machines with the right size and redundancy  
✅ Use Availability Sets and Zones for high availability (HA)  
✅ Create and deploy web applications using Azure App Service  
✅ Implement a load-balanced, resilient compute architecture  
✅ Connect compute services with storage and monitoring tools
